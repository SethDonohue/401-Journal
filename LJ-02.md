### 401 Daily Learning Journal - 02

## What I learned
- A bunch about promises and callbacks that is hard to explain.
- .then and .catch will be key for basically everything we do form here on out it sounds like
- how to properly make calls for POST, GET, PUT, DELETE in a RESTful API/Server setup
- how to setup a basic HTTP server
- some new syntax for ES6
- Better methods for whiteboarding, and how to test my solution in an efficient way
- calculate the BiG O for my whiteboarding solution


## What was Frustrating
- Missing out on code review has made me not understand some concepts..
- Still a bit fuzzy on linked lists, but practicing more.
- I don't have my methods vocabulary at a good level yet to do whiteboarding properly... I need to understand more about array methods, linked lists, and other methods to use for whiteboarding. Maybe classic flashcards will help me study this, but i bet there is something online somewhere that could let me study these things.


### Project Ideas
- Think i'll do something with a NASA API...
