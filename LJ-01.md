### 401 Daily Learning Journal - 01

## What I learned
- What the Call stack is, the event loop and queue. This makes more sense to what is going on in the browsers since JS is technically single threaded.
-The Event Loop is simple, it looks at the stack and task queue, is the stack is empty it takes the first thing in the queue and pushes it to the stack.

## What was Frustrating
- Today's lab was fairly confusing at the beginning. The callbacks still get me lost, but after asking around it made more sense... Hopefully it wil lbe extra clear soon.

## Group Stuff
- Nothing in groups yet, but plenty of group work on the individual labs.

## Extras?
