### 401 Learning Journal - Week 06

## What I learned
- React, componenets, apps, and how to structure our apps so that the children and parents work together correctly.
- Enzyme and how to do basic tests on React and our routes with jest
- State, UI State, NO state and the difference between them all and how to diagram a plan for how our App and it's components work together as it can get confusing realy fast!
- What Babel, React, Sass, and all the loaders are and do for use of React.
- more ES6 notation and making sure we setup babel correctly to ensure that it transpiles properly for older support
- Hooks, Member Functions and sort of what they are.
-


## What was Frustrating
- There wasn't much of a lesson plan being followed on the first couple days of this week which gave me a bad foundation for understanding the beginngins of React and Webpack, etc.
- The new Whiteboarding sessions with a student being and interviewer and another student as interviewee makes it difficutl for both sides to learn more whiteboarding.
I feel as if we should go back to what we were doing before so that the interviewee is not stuck when the interviewer doesn't fully understand the solution.
